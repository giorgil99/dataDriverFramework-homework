i had to make constunt updates to previous homeworks due to having single connector class for all conections
(i think that's not a bad thing)

had to rebuild   JDBC_Getting Started _ Homework due to getGeneratedkeys method not working as intended.

in Excel && Stored Procedure Homework had to fix version compatibility error and added dinamism to dataprovider object.




here is a map for each homewrok: 


For

JDBC_Getting Started _ Homework 


run DataDrivenTest.java



for 

SQL Querying Homework

run TestWithSQL.java 



for Excel && Stored Procedure Homework

run StoredProcedure.java and ExcelDrivenTest.java 



p.s

RowCounter.java and ServerConnector.java are helper classes.
